Interactive communications programs have become extremely popular in recent years.  Applications like ICQ, MSN messenger and Skype are installed on almost every desktop computer.  The goal of this project is to develop a communication protocol that enables users to have text conversations. This project handles all the needed communication phase, including protocols, user discovery, multi-user (more than 2) conversations, etc.  We will use some ideas done in Skype in order to communicate between the users.
